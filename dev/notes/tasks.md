    - Can we use apple photos people for 'mother' and 'baby'?
    - I want to wire like specific persons
        - by name?
        - Or how?
        - I guess they have some contact id, but i don't want to have to enter that
    - Maybe search + select
    - Or, for now, if there's a single person in contacts with that name
        - use that
        - else
            - raise notimpelented

      Load images from user folder instead of including resources in the package. Bonus: Auto-generate words for images and use that set in text

    - Gamify keyboard locker somehow
    - Idea 1: Add a new mode, where the baby has to type the word correctly for it to appear on the screen and be
      pronounced
    - When baby types the letters correctly - make them appear on screen (e.g. if she types 'M' - show 'M', then add
      'A' etc.). Allow any words from selected word sets.
      Some nice animation when the word is completed correctly
    - Add a setting checkbox "reset on error".

    - Add more images
    - use planned llm utils to bulk-generate the set (look at ~/calmmage/experiments/llm/dev/notes)
    - also, first, think if / where can i get nice image collections for basic words on the web
    - there should be default 'alphabet' images, right? 
    - also there should probably some nice art projects with stylized alphabet images
      (i mean not only aphabet of course - but in general basic simple words)
